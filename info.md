<b>trust management system in C++ </b>

About Project
The foundation of a trust management system is the idea of recording customer account information. The user can complete all actions here, including opening an account, depositing money, withdrawing money, checking the balance, viewing information about every account holder, closing an account, and editing an account.
This project has all the essential components for a financial system in place.

In terms of the characteristics of the Trust Management System, a user can create an account by giving their name, account number, the type of account they want to open (savings or current), and an initial sum of money. The user can then deposit and withdraw funds by simply entering an amount and providing his or her account information. The system will then display the user's profile. For a specific purpose, he or she can also run a balance enquiry, which shows the name of the account holder together with the kind and balance of the account. Additionally, he or she can look up a list of all account holders. The user can also close their account by entering their account number, and they can change their account type and details if they so choose.
